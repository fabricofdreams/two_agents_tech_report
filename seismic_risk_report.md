Based on the earthquake data in Greece, the highest magnitude earthquake during the period studied was recorded on 6/15/1979 at coordinates (34.8, 24.1) with a magnitude of 5.1.

In the last 30 days, the two areas with the highest seismic activity are as follows:
1. Coordinates (39.7, 23.0) - Magnitude 3.3 earthquake on 12/30/1979 at 9:20
2. Coordinates (39.1, 23.2) - Magnitude 3.3 earthquake on 12/30/1979 at 14:27

Brief Description of Areas:
1. The area with coordinates (39.7, 23.0) has experienced a moderate level of seismic activity in the last 30 days, with multiple earthquakes recorded at a magnitude of 3.3. This area may be considered a hotspot for seismic activity and should be closely monitored for any potential risks.
2. The area with coordinates (39.1, 23.2) has also shown significant seismic activity with a magnitude 3.3 earthquake occurring on 12/30/1979 at 14:27. This area is another focal point for seismic activity and warrants attention from authorities to assess the potential risks and implement necessary precautions.
